CMake Deprecation Warning:
  Support for "Extra Generators" like

    CodeBlocks

  is deprecated and will be removed from a future version of CMake.  IDEs may
  use the cmake-file-api(7) to view CMake-generated project build trees.


CMake Deprecation Warning at cmake-build-debug/_deps/sfml-src/CMakeLists.txt:5 (cmake_minimum_required):
  Compatibility with CMake < 3.5 will be removed from a future version of
  CMake.

  Update the VERSION argument <min> value or use a ...<max> suffix to tell
  CMake that the project does not need compatibility with older versions.


CMake Warning (dev) at C:/Program Files/JetBrains/CLion 2024.1.4/bin/cmake/win/x64/share/cmake-3.28/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:438 (message):
  The package name passed to `find_package_handle_standard_args` (VORBIS)
  does not match the name of the calling package (Vorbis).  This can lead to
  problems in calling code that expects `find_package` result variables
  (e.g., `_FOUND`) to follow a certain pattern.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  cmake-build-debug/_deps/sfml-src/cmake/Modules/FindVorbis.cmake:25 (find_package_handle_standard_args)
  cmake-build-debug/_deps/sfml-src/cmake/Macros.cmake:279 (find_package)
  cmake-build-debug/_deps/sfml-src/src/SFML/Audio/CMakeLists.txt:70 (sfml_find_package)
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.
